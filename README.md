# 🌫️ Air Pollution and Asthma Trends in Indian Cities

This project explores the relationship between **PM2.5 pollution levels** and **asthma-related search trends** in India using real-world air quality data and Google Trends.

## 📁 Contents
- `air_pollution_heath_impact.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook (with markdown explanations)
- `delhi_pm25_2022_2023_sample.csv`: PM2.5 dataset


## 📊 Project Summary
We conducted:
- Weekly resampling of air pollution data
- Merging with Google Trends on "asthma"
- Correlation and lag analysis
- Feature engineering (temperature, season)
- Final regression model (R² = **0.444**)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, pandas, numpy, seaborn
- scikit-learn, statsmodels, pytrends
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates how data science and public data sources can be combined to analyze **public health impact of environmental pollution**. Useful for government, urban planning, and health research.
